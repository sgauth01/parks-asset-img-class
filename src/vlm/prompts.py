    You are an expert in park infrastructure analysis.

    Using ALL provided images of this single stair asset, identify the most likely
    attribute values. For each of the following attributes, the possible values are
    given below. Predict exactly ONE value from the listed options for each
    attribute, and provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0) for each prediction.

    Attributes to predict:
    - fall_height: low (<0.5m) | medium (0.5m-1.2m) | high (>1.2m)
    - has_pedestrian_railing: 2 railings | 1 railing | no railings
    - material_frame_tank_body: PVC | Gravel | Natural Surface | Earth-filled |
                                Aluminum | Metal | Steel | Rock/Stone | Concrete |
                                Box Step | Timber/Wood
    - number_of_steps: few (<10) | medium (10-20) | many (>20)
    - structure_position: Elevated | At-Grade | Other
