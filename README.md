# parks-asset-img-class

## Project overview

This repository contains early work for a 2026 UBC MDS capstone project on using image analysis to classify BC Parks infrastructure assets and predict attributes such as asset type, material, railing presence, size ranges, structure position, and number of steps.

At the moment, the main runnable artifact is a Quarto report:

- `reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.qmd`

Rendering this file creates both:

- `reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.html`
- `reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.pdf`

## Repository structure

    └── references.bib
```

## Setup

Create and activate the Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bcparks_capstone
```

The report is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Install Quarto if it is not already available:

```bash
quarto --version
```

PDF rendering also requires a LaTeX installation. If PDF rendering fails because LaTeX is missing, install TinyTeX with:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```

## Render the report

From the repository root, run:

```bash
quarto render reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.qmd
```

This command renders all formats listed in the report YAML, currently HTML and PDF.

To render only one format:

```bash
quarto render reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.qmd --to html
quarto render reports/Image_analysis_of_park_infrastructure_report.qmd --to pdf
```

## Experiment tracking with MLflow

All model runs are tracked with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/). The
default tracking store is a local file directory at `./mlruns` (gitignored),
so no server is required and nothing leaves the machine.

End-to-end smoke test (synthetic data only, no SharePoint download needed):

```bash
python scripts/mlflow_smoke_test.py
```

This fits a `MajorityClassPredictor` on a synthetic 3-class target and a
`MedianRegressor` on a synthetic numeric target, and writes both runs
to `./mlruns` under the experiment **`parks-asset-img-class`**.

View the runs in your browser:

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:./mlruns
```

Programmatic logging:

```python
from src.baseline import MajorityClassPredictor
from src.mlflow_utils import (
    setup_mlflow, log_classification_run,
    make_run_name, make_standard_tags,
)

setup_mlflow()  # uses ./mlruns

clf = MajorityClassPredictor().fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

log_classification_run(
    run_name=make_run_name("T2_decking_material", "majority_class"),
    tags=make_standard_tags(
        task="T2_decking_material",
        model_family="baseline",
        model_name="majority_class",
        data_version="2026-05-05",
        split_seed=42,
    ),
    params={"n_train": len(y_train), "majority_class": str(clf.fitted_value_)},
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=y_pred,
)
```

Standard tags every run carries: `task`, `model_family`, `model_name`,
`data_version`, `split_seed`. Standard metrics: `accuracy`, `macro_f1`,
`weighted_f1`, `per_class_f1.json`, and `confusion_matrix.json` for
classification; `mae`, `rmse`, `r2` for regression.

Run the unit tests:

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_mlflow_utils.py
```

## Current status

This project is in an early exploratory stage. The report currently describes the project motivation, research question, dataset assumptions, data challenges, and a proposed modelling approach. The notebook directory is available for exploration work as the project develops.
